### What is yaConverter?

You're at the main page of yaConverter and you just found the good way! yaConverter is extension for programmers that allows you to simply convert almost all known units in the world by using very simple and adjustable functions. You can even convert one unit to two! For example: Feet to Miles and Yards. Just a single folder with some light-weight files. No composer needed to install, just move folder to your project. Also, I offer a great support, ready to help you and open for suggestions and edits! Good luck and thanks for choosing yaConverter! :D

```text
$outputs = InterUnits::CmToFtIn(160);
echo $outputs["feet"]." ft and ".$outputs["inches"]." inches.";
```
